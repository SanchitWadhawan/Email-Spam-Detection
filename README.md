The idea of this post is to understand step by step working of the spam filter and how it helps in making everyone life easier. Also, next time when you see a “You have won a lottery” email rather than ignoring it, you might prefer to report it as a spam.
Generally when someone asks, what is logistic regression? what do you tell them — Oh! it is an algorithm which is used for categorizing things into two classes (most of the time) i.e. the result is measured using a dichotomous variable. But, how does logistic regression classify thing into classes like -binomial(2 possible values), multinomial(3 or more possible values) and ordinal(deals with ordered categories). For this post we will only be focusing on binomial logistic regression i.e. the outcome of the model will be categorized into two classes.

Logistic Regression
According to Wikipedia definition,

Logistic Regression measures the relationship between the categorical dependent variable and one or more independent variables by estimating probabilities using a logistic function.
